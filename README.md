# HPC Development Kit (HPCDK) for AWS

HPCDK for AWS is a library of recipes you can use with AWS ParallelCluster to deploy HPC infrastructure on the cloud.

## About this repository

The AWS HPC Team provides and maintains recipes tagged with `core`. The core recipes include  networking setups, filesystem configurations, and other foundational bits. They also include some example ParallelCluster deployments that illustrate some of its advanced features. Core recipes are updated with each new ParallelCluster release, and are tested routinely. We also collect and make available templates developed by the broader community. These are tagged with `community`.  We encourage contributions of new recipes or improvements on existing ones. Please note that we don't test, maintain, or support community recipes.

## The recipe library

Recipes are in namespaced directories under the [`recipes`](/recipes/) folder. We generate the README file in that folder from the list of active recipes to provide a simple discovery interface.
