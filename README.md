# HPC Development Kit (HPCDK) for AWS

HPCDK for AWS is a library of recipes for extending and building on AWS ParallelCluster to deploy HPC infrastructure on the cloud. HPCDK recipes are designed to be customizable and extensible, and also to serve as documentation of innovative or best practices in HPC infrastructure design. 

## About the repository

The AWS HPC Engineering Team and approved contributors provide and maintain recipes tagged with `core`. We also collect and make available templates developed by the community. These are tagged with `community`.  We encourage community contributions of new recipes or improvements on existing ones. Please note that we don't test, maintain, or support community recipes.

## The recipe library

All recipes are in the `recipes` folder. Each recipe has its own documentation that builds on the general documentation provided here. 

## Contributing

We encourage you to contribute to HPCDK! Read up on our [contribution process and guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and share your best material with the HPC community.
