You can access recipe assets using HTTPS or S3 protocols.
* AWS S3 HTTP URL - https://hpcdk-on-aws.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/VERSION/recipes/NAMESPACE/RECIPE/assets/

Generally, use `main` for the version, unless you need to pin to a specific {{ repo_name }} release. If that's the case, replace `main` with a release tags such as `v1.0.0`.
