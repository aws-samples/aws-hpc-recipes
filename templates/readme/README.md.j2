# HPC Recipes for AWS

This page shows [all available recipes](#recipe-list). They are organized by theme (e.g. `Database management` and `Networking`). Each recipe also has tags that indicate the key technologies (i.e. `parallelcluster` and `rds`) it references. 

## Making use of recipes

You can use an AWS HPC recipe in several ways:

* **Learn from it.** Read the README file and inspect its `assets` directory to understand how it works. 
* **Launch resources with it.** Navigate to its README page and follow the instructions. There is often a quick-launch link to the AWS CloudFormation console.
* **Incorporate it.** Recipe assets are permissively licensed so you can use them in your own builds. You can also [bring assets in by URL](#incorporating-recipe-assets)

## Incorporating recipe assets

You can access recipe assets using HTTPS or S3 protocols. They are mirrored to an S3 bucket so they can used with AWS CloudFormation. 

Here are example URLs for the CloudFormation launch template for the "latest" ParallelCluster recipe (**recipes/pcluster/latest**):
* **HTTPS Template**: https://{{_internal.s3_bucket}}.s3.{{_internal.region}}.amazonaws.com/main/recipes/pcluster/latest/assets/launch.yaml
* **S3 Template**: s3://{{_internal.s3_bucket}}/main/recipes/pcluster/latest/assets/launch.yaml

In both URLs, `/main/` is the HPC Recipes on AWS version. At present, the only supported version is **main**. 

You can use the HTTPS link in a couple of contexts.
1. You can download the file it references
    * `curl -O HTTPS_URL`
2. If it's a Cloudformation template, you can import it into the CloudFormation console when creating a stack
3. You can embed it in a CloudFormation [quick-launch link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-stacks-quick-create-links.html).
    * **Template**: `https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=REGION#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=HTTPS_URL`

The S3 URL is useful anywhere you want to use native S3 commands for data access. 
* **Template**: `aws s3 cp s3://aws-hpc-recipes/main/recipes/NAMESPACE/RECIPE/assets/FILE.yaml .`
